# Introduction

This is a fictional website (for educational purposes) for fans of a certain band to share the setlists the band has played at their gigs.  Not only does this help the fan feel like part of the bands fanbase, but allows other fans to see what songs the band have been playing live.

[Back to top ⇧](#Setlist-Sharer)

# Admin Setup

THE FOLLOWING HAS BEEN LEFT IN FOR FINAL DEPLOYMENT SO THE SITE CAN BE USED FROM THE START.  Please not that all images etc are only placeholders
and do not represent what will be included when the site is used properly.

Before the site can be used the admin will set up the required fields in the database, using the admin pannel in the following order:

1. Venues

The name of the Venue and the City.

2. Gigs

Once Venues have been entered the Gig Date and Venue can be added.  The Image selection will be left blank and the Image Status will be automatically set to "No Image".  When a user submits an image the status changes to 1.

3. Songs

The name of the bands song should then be entered.

4. Releases

The titles of the bands releases (this could be the name of a Single, EP, Album, Demo etc).  A song can appear on multiple releases and are selected whilst entering releases.

# Once Deployed
Once the site is in use the admin can change the status of submitted Setlists or Photos.  When they are set to "Published" they will be included in the site.

# UX and Design

## User Demographics

The target market are fans of the particular band, especially those who are wanting to feel conected to the band and part of their community.

[Back to top ⇧](#Setlist-Sharer)
## User Stories

User Stories were added to the Git Hub project board and can be read from [here](https://github.com/mjjstockman/setlistsharer/issues)

A kanban was used to keep an agile view on user stories.  Below is an example of the kanban at a particular set of time.

## Wireframes

| --------------| -------------- |

| Setlist/detail |<img  src="docs/readme_images/wireframes/small/setlist-detail/setlist_detail_author.jpg"  alt="Wireframe of the setlist detail page as author on a small screen">

| Setlist/add |<img  src="docs/readme_images/wireframes/small/setlist_add/setlist_add.jpg"  alt="Wireframe of the setlist add page on a small screen"> 


Wireframes were being made for other screen sizes, but throught development it became clear that the design would be suitable across screen sizes, so the designs were scrapped.

## Database Design
<img  src="docs/readme_images/general/ERD.jpg"  alt="Entity Relationship Diagram">

## Changes to the design throughout development

The design for the small sized screens were kept for all sizes.  

The home app was created to seperate some of the logic.  This is possibly not the best design to use but was done so to see how this would be implemented.  Another app called addimage was used to increase future usability in different apps, but this was not fully realised.

## Typography

[Typespiration](https://typespiration.com/) was used to find complimenting [Google Font](https://fonts.google.com) pairings, with the following decided upon:

- Headings: Open Sans, with a fallback of serif. 
- Body: Crimson Text, with a fallback of sans-serif.

# Features

## Navigation and Header

The navigation bar allows the user to easily select which area of the site they wish to view. It will be located at the top of the site as this is common practice and is the area where most users eyes will be initially drawn to. It will be not be'sticky', as the main links a user will need when scrolling are provided. When a link is hovered over it becomes highlighted to help the user confirm they are about to select the relevant link. The highlight remains once selected.

The 'hamburger' icon was used on small screens (where the navigation bar will collapse and be represented as three horizontal lines. When touched/clicked, this displays the navigation in a dropdown menu). This is done due to the limited real estate space making the text hard to read when the screen is this size.

<img src="docs/readme_images/features/nav/nav-hamburger.png"  alt="Nav at mobile size showing the hamburger icon">

The logo is displayed on the left hand side and the nav on the right.

If the user is logged in the navigation displys the following links for Home and Logout:
<img src="docs/readme_images/features/nav/nav-loggedin.png"  alt="Nav at mobile size showing the hamburger icon">


If the user is not logged in the navigation displys the following links for Home and Sign Up and Login:

<img src="docs/readme_images/features/nav/nav-not-loggedin.png"  alt="Nav at mobile size showing the hamburger icon">


[Back to top ⇧](#Setlist-Sharer)
## Hero Image

An eye-catching full screen image is placed under the navigation. This helps grab the users attention and convey positive, professional feelings.  This also holds some text that is centered.

<img src="docs/readme_images/features/hero-img.png"  alt="Nav at mobile size showing the hamburger icon">

[Back to top ⇧](#Setlist-Sharer)

## About Information Box

A small section containing introductory information is placed below the hero image. This helps to quickly confirm to the user that they are on the correct site. It offers general information on the sites pupose, so they understand its goal.

[Back to top ⇧](#Setlist-Sharer)

## Gigs
All the gigs the admin has entered are shown on the hopme page with their date, venue and city.

Below the gig info an image is displayed with two buttons opposite.

<img src="docs/readme_images/features/gigs/gig-and-btns.png"  alt="Nav at mobile size showing the hamburger icon">

[Back to top ⇧](#Setlist-Sharer)

## Setlists
If a setlist has not yet been submitted, the user can create one to submit by clicking on the Add Setlist button.

If a setlist has been submitted but not yet confirmed this is shown to the user.

If a setlist have been confirmed by the site admin they can be viewed by clicking on the View Setlist button.

If the author of a setlist is signed in they can edit or delete the setlist.

If the logged in user is not the author of the setlist they can agree or disagree with it by clicking on the appropriate button in the setlist detail page.

[Back to top ⇧](#Setlist-Sharer)

## Photos
If a photo has not yet been submitted, the user can create one to submit one clicking on the Add Photo button.

If a photo has been submitted but not yet confirmed this is shown to the user.

If a photo have been confirmed by the site admin they are displayed on the home page.


[Back to top ⇧](#Setlist-Sharer)

## Footer

The footer feature at the bottom of the page lets users know who it was developed by.


[Back to top ⇧](#Setlist-Sharer)

# Features to Implement in the future

Allow the order of songs played to be submitted and displayed.

Fully implement automated testing.

Combine the agree / disagree logic for setlists.
 
Automatically email the admin when a new setlist or photo has been selected.

Allow the user to delete a photo they have submitted.

Correctly seperate the project into seperate apps for reusability.  This was attempted (seperating adding an image and home etc. into their own models) but not fully realised due to time constraints.  Prefably, the addimage (and possibly the home app) models, views etc should have been moved back into the setlist app.

# Testing

Details on site testing can be found [here](TESTING.md).

[Back to top ⇧](#Hull-College)

# Bugs

## Bugs found throughout Development
Active pages were not being highlighted properly in the nav.  This was due to the nav being part of a base template.  The following article helped: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39639264/django-highlight-current-page-in-navbar


## Remaining Bugs
The hero div is not resizing on larger screens.
